[clvrk](https://github.com/clvrk) - After tuning into Mercury's development streams, I can say without a doubt that his proficiency in Web development is un-peered by people his age and he stands among those with experience. He has helped me out with API related questions and is capable of making straight-forward & clean Websites half of the devs these days couldn't even dream of developing.

[Milo](https://github.com/Iapetus-11/) - Kevin and I have been through a lot, teaching each other many things as we have traversed the world of programming. Without him, I wouldn't have learned JavaScript and probably would still be using thonny as an IDE.

[milanmdev](https://github.com/milanmdev) - Mercury has supported me through a lot of my different projects. He helped me with getting my own bot list & other sites up and running. I don't know much about nginx, etc but Mercury makes it easy to understand. Thanks Mercury for everything!

[wulf](https://github.com/itsmewulf) - I've known Mercury for quite some time now, and I can confidently say that his knowledge and skillset is absolutely outstanding for developers not only his age, but also in general. While I know this repo is mainly meant for dev-related thank-you's, I'd like to say that Kevin is without a doubt the most like-minded software developer I've met along my programming journey so far; he gave lots of important feedback on my applications, and I've also picked up some nice tips and tricks along the way :smile:

[Havish](https://github.com/havishpallerla) - You know why I'm taking the time to write this? Because I know Kevin's going to achieve his dreams & goals and I'll be able to be put on the spotlight in this repository. He's helped me several times by giving out advice, feedback, and tips. And I know that Kevin's going to reach tremendous heights as an entrepreneur. :smile:

[Issai](https://github.com/TheLimifiedLime) - Without Mercury I would not know as much as I know about programming as I do now. Thanks to Mercury I have gotten farther than I ever thought. Mercury is a great person with amaing skills and I know he will get far. If you can name it he can do it.

[Colin](https://github.com/KO4JZT) - In my time working with Kevin at KOA, I learned how incredible of a developer he is. Even as a fellow young programmer, I have never met anyone close to his age with such great skill that is continuing to rapidly grow. Kevin makes a great addition to any project, big or small.

[Sh-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)[wayz](https://github.com/sh-wayz) - Kevin is a pretty great guy to have developing with you, he's got a lot of drive and willingness to learn, and is way more experienced than I would ever expect from someone his age. Overall a really skilled dude that is fun to work with.
